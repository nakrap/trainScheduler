# Train Scheduler

Train app using Firebase. Adds new trains based on user input, and then calculates when the next train will arrive.


## How it Works:

Trains are made up by the users, and then logged to Goggle's Firebase. Once a user adds a train, the current time is automatically calculated using moment.js. 


## Running the app:
```
1. Start by entering all of the information in the "Add Train" section. 
2. Navigate to the other tab/window, and enter a username and email address for User 2.
3. Navigate back to User 1's tab, and click the 'ihaveArrived' button. 
4. Navigate to User 2's tab, and click the 'onTheWay' button.
```
